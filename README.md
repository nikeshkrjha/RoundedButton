# RoundedButton
Button with rounded edge in iOS using swift 3

The button here behaves like a toggle button. You can just add the RoundedRectButton.swift file in your project and start working.

If you don't want the toggle button behavior you can set the appropriate background color in awakeFromNib() method and comment out the touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) method.
